# Learn-OpenCV


## **OpenCV** was started at Intel in 1999 by **Gary Bradsky**, and the first release came out in 2000.

It is a Python library which is designed to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV was originally developed in 1999 by Intel but later it was supported by **Willow Garage**.

It supports a wide variety of programming languages such as C++, Python, Java etc. Support for multiple platforms including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

**OpenCV Python** is nothing but a **wrapper class** for the original **C++ library to be used with Python**. Using this, all of the OpenCV array structures gets converted to/from NumPy arrays. This makes it easier to integrate it with other libraries which use NumPy. For example, libraries such as SciPy and Matplotlib.

The Python Notebook covers the following chapters: 

**Chapter 1**: How to read, write, and display Images & Videos
**Chapter 2**: Basic Functions
**Chapter 3**: Shapes and Texts
**Chapter 4**: Joining Images
**Chapter 5**: Mini-Projects -

  - Face Detection on Images, Videos, & in Real-time
  - Face and Eyes Detection in Real-time
  - Pedestrians Detection
